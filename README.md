# Portfolio-project-1-Database-Schema-SQL-Queries-and-Excel-Visualizations

<u>For this project I was presented with the following scenario:<u>

Client Ben is opening a new pizzeria and would like us to design & build a bespoke relational
database for him, he would also like us to query the data in ways which he can use in the future
to glean insights and observe key metrics for his business. To end the project off, I will create a simple dashoboard in Excel to wrap everything up.
